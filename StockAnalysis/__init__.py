    """ apply the blueprints to the app
    Each Flask Blueprint is an object that works very similarly to a Flask application. 
    They both can have resources, such as static files, templates, and views that are associated with routes.
    However, a Flask Blueprint is not actually an application. It needs to be registered in an application before you can run it. 
    When you register a Flask Blueprint in an application, youâ€™re actually extending the application with the contents of the Blueprint.
    This is the key concept behind any Flask Blueprint. They record operations to be executed later when you register them on an application. 
    For example, when you associate a view to a route in a Flask Blueprint, it records this association to be made later in the application when the Blueprint is registered.
